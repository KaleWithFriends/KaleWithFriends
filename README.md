## Overview

Eating local produce is healthy and helps boost the local economy, but knowing what is available and getting it when it's at its freshest can be a challenge. Kale With Friends (working title) connects consumers and producers so everyone is aware of what is available nearby, where to buy it and how much it costs. If you grow produce, whether in a backyard garden or large scale commercial farm, and are interested in selling it, KWF will bring the local consumers to you.

Kale With Friends is a social style site intended to connect consumers with local farmers and producers. There are two types of profiles; consumers and farmers. Farmers create their profile to advertise what they have available and where it can be bought. This could be at their own farm, or a nearby farmer's market. The consumer profile allows individuals to search nearby events and farms to see what is fresh and available, where to buy it, and even create meals based on what is available at the moment. Users can search through a public cookbook, select their favorite recipes and see which ingredients are available locally.


## Approach

There are two main parts to this project, the social network and the meal planner/cookbook. We plan to split the work into these two sections and have a team of two people focusing on each part. There will be considerable overlap in the backend data between the two parts, so we will have to do design the data structures as a single team. All code and assets will be stored in a single GitHub reqpository and the site itself will be built using the Play Framework and Twitter Bootstrap. Once complete it will be deployable on Heroku.
